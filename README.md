Emdaq Utilities
==========

Emdaq.Util has basic utilties.

Emdaq.DataAccess has data access utilties for a service/repository pattern, wrapping Dapper.NET. The full benefit of this setup can be seen at the service level, with cross-repo transactions.

For an example repository using the pattern, see https://github.com/emdaq/util/blob/master/Emdaq.ExampleDataAccess/Repository/EmailRepo.cs
